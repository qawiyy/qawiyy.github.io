					<h3>Pierce Brosnan</h3>
						<p>Pierce Brosnan’s performance as 007 captured the timeless appeal of the character in a new world of high-technology and post-Cold War intrigue. Born in Ireland in 1953, Brosnan carved out a distinguished career as an artist and circus fire eaterbefore starring in Tennessee Williams’s The Red Devil Battery Sign in London. After	
						marrying Bond girl Cassandra Harris, Brosnan was considered for the part of Bond in 1986 but commitments to TV drama Remington Steele meant that he didn’t don 007’s tuxedo until 1995. He was awarded an OBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his 'outstanding contribution to the British film industry.'</p>

					<h3>Sean Connery</h3>
						<p>Sean Connery was the first actor to bring Ian Fleming’s James Bond to the movie screen. Born in a working-class neighbourhood of Edinburgh, Connery joined the Navy at an early age and afterwards worked as a bricklayer, lifeguard and French polisher. In his spare time he enjoyed bodybuilding. This hobby led to modelling and small theatrical parts that	
						included training with Swedish dancer Yat Malmgren. These experiences instilled in him the masculine grace and air of confidence that producers Albert R. “Cubby” Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were looking for in their 007, Connery received a Lifetime Achievement award at the 1996 Golden Globes and a knighthood in 2000 among many other tributes.</p>

					<h3>Daniel Craig</h3>
						<p>Daniel Craig brought the danger, seductive rawness and realism to Bond that the 2006 reboot of the series demanded. Born in Chester, England, in 1968, Craig worked in television and with some of the world’s leading directors, including Sam Mendes who he would later collaborate with on	
						SKYFALL, before being cast as 007 in 2005. While taking cues from every one of the previous Bond actors, Craig has redefined James Bond for the 21st Century, exploring new depths in the character and met the challenge of filmmaking with a commitment to performing many of his own stunts.</p>
